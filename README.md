# ATU-Year-1-GUI-Group-Project
Group project for GUI and Web Development module in my first year of ATU.

We couldn't manage to finish this in time. But I think we did a decent enough job. We couldn't get the total cost to work. 
Chris has some files that we couldnt use because it was all hard coded but we wanted him to get marks too. He did attempt.
We don't really know what DOM styling and event listeners were tricky. 
Even though we are submitting this early, we wouldn't have the time to finish the coupon code and stuff like that.
